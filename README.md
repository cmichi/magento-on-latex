# Magento on LaTeX

This is an extension for Magento which serves pdf invoices generated from a LaTeX template. 

This means that it is very easy to modify your invoice template, so that it uses your corporate design etc..

This also means that your invoices will stop looking poor and start looking tight :)

  
  
**PLEASE NOTE: The extension is under heavy development and will not work out-of-the box!**




## Motivation

I was working a lot with LaTeX in the past months and since I had to create invoices  
for the Magento Shopsystem which fit to the german law - which is not so easy :).
I decided to take the opportunity and write an extension for this.

Nearly none normal web server runs TeX out of the box,  
but since it is really easy to install a TeX distribution like TexLive, this shouldn't be a problem if you own a root server.



## Templates

Still under development!

The extension will come with two LaTeX templates: 

* German invoice for consumers
* German invoice for retailers
* Very basic english invoice 

You can modify the templates by copying them into /media/latextemplate/.
